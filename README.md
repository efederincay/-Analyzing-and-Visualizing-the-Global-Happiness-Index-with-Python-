# -Analyzing-and-Visualizing-the-Global-Happiness-Index-with-Python-
The objective of the project is to analyze and visualize the insights of the Global Happiness Index using Python.  
It combines **data analysis, machine learning, and interactive visualization** to explore the factors that influence happiness worldwide.

---

##  Project Overview

The **World Happiness Report** ranks countries based on several key indicators such as GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and corruption.  
In this project, we performed:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Statistical and correlation analysis  
- Visualization of global patterns  
- Building **interactive dashboards** using Streamlit and Plotly  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Freedom** and **Social Support** are the strongest predictors of happiness.  
- While GDP is important, **social and political factors** play a greater role.  
- **Northern Europe** (Finland, Denmark, Iceland) consistently leads global happiness rankings.  
- Visual dashboards make it easier to compare countries and understand year-over-year changes.
